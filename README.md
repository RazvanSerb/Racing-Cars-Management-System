This project is divided into three sections:
- The first section consists of overlooking and managing racing cars' sensors in different operations
(this section is a C-based program).
- The second section focuses especially on data transfer between the mechanics and the racer.
Data is transferred through encrypted communication, so it was necessary to come up with and develop
some specific algorithms, such as Simple Cypher/Polyalphabetic Substitution Cypher (Enigma Machine).
However, in this section, I also analyse the racing strategies through resembling them to a checkers game.
(this section is an ASM-based program)
- The third section principally consists in the enforcement of safety within data transfer.
(this section is also an ASM-based program).
